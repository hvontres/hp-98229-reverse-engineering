# hp 98229 Memory Module reverse engineering
This is an attempt at documenting the HP 98229 Memory module used in the HP 9000 375/380/385 models.

It comes in 2mb, 4mb 8mb and 16mb sizes. The 4mb size seems to exist in two flavors: the older version using 36 256K x 4 memory chips and a newer version using 9 1M x 4 chips.
